        <h2>Navigate Me To The Moon</h2>
        <h3>05/14/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I am continuing to update my page. One thing I noticed is that my navigation is smaller on the index page than the others. Also, the social media icons on the right are further out on the About/Contact pages compared to the Experiments/Journal pages. I don't know why it's jumping, tried the Inspector, I'm guessing it has something to do with the body width, but not sure how that would impact the top part. Very confused about that.</p>

        <h2>We're Breaking Up</h2>
        <h3>05/06/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I did some revamping on the site and now things are starting to look a little weird. The gradients aren't working on Safari and then on Chrome, the page is different proportions between the homepage and the subpages. The experiment confused me to. Couldn't figure out how to display the two different parts of the rectangle in line.</p>

        <h2>Who Knew?</h2>
        <h3>04/29/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>For some reason, I was under the impression that embedding fonts was a lot more challenging than it actually is. But wow, that was very easy and worth the effort. Now I know!</p>

        <h2>Floating On Up</h2>
        <h3>04/23/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I think I understand floats a little more than I have before. I still don't really get the concept behind "clearing." I've always put 'clear' in my css, but don't know if I get the reasoning. I see the effects of not having it in there though.</p>

        <h2>Gitting The Hang Of It</h2>
        <h3>04/14/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I have to admit something. I've had my MacBook for 5 years now. I've never opened up Terminal before. Just seeing that box makes me think of my days on Windows.</p><br />
          <p>I'm brushing up on my HTML and CSS "skills." I have done some work previously in school and for some freelance clients, but never felt completey confident to handle web projects that came my way.</p><br />
          <p>Learning how to use GitHub has been interesting. I want to learn more about how it works in the "real world," especially since I'm used to using FTP systems to push work live.</p><br />
          <p>I'm also interesting in learning more about HTML5. These new structural elements introduced in week 2 are new to me and I'm sure they are great tools for SEO. I'd like to learn more about they benefit other areas of web development.</p>
