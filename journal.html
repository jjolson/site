        <h2>Floating On Up</h2>
        <h3>04/23/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I think I understand floats a little more than I have before. I still don't really get the concept behind "clearing." I've always put 'clear' in my css, but don't know if I get the reasoning. I see the effects of not having it in there though.</p>

        <h2>Gitting The Hang Of It</h2>
        <h3>04/14/2013 . Chicago, IL</h3>
          <p>I have to admit something. I've had my MacBook for 5 years now. I've never opened up Terminal before. Just seeing that box makes me think of my days on Windows.</p><br />
          <p>I'm brushing up on my HTML and CSS "skills." I have done some work previously in school and for some freelance clients, but never felt completey confident to handle web projects that came my way.</p><br />
          <p>Learning how to use GitHub has been interesting. I want to learn more about how it works in the "real world," especially since I'm used to using FTP systems to push work live.</p><br />
          <p>I'm also interesting in learning more about HTML5. These new structural elements introduced in week 2 are new to me and I'm sure they are great tools for SEO. I'd like to learn more about they benefit other areas of web development.</p>
